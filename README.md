# COMAP_Project_AC
Work completed on the COMAP project with Stuart Harper. Aiming to quantify various features in the M31 maps and find methods to reduce noise levels of the maps.

A report of my results can be found in Report.pdf. For reference I have also uploaded the Initial Maps.pdf, which shows all of the maps that I have used in my work. The Source Fits.pdf file shows the Gaussian fits performed on each of the maps.

In the code directory I have included all the code used to reproduce my results.
## Code
### ReadMaps
This file is used in the other modules to read in the maps from .fits file.
